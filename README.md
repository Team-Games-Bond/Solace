# Project Information
Solace is a puzzle-based game where you play as a soul navigating through a brain. As you progress, you encounter different brain-related puzzles, each symbolising different aspects to achieve mental clarity. The game subtly promotes health awareness through tasks that reflect mental aspects such as resilience, organisation, and focus. Collect crystals representing various elements of mental well-being as you clear brain fog through completing puzzles and unlocking powercubes. Solace provides an engaging experience, encouraging players to reflect on their mental health and promote ways of achieving mental clarity.

Our team used [Jira](https://cs399-team-35.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/CC/boards/1/timeline) as our project management tool. We followed an Agile methodology, incorporating Kanban as our primary tool to manage our workflow. Our Gantt Chart was created on [Team Gantt](https://www.teamgantt.com/). To track client and group meeting minutes, reports and documentation, we used a shared Google Drive. Our group meetings were held in person, on our Discord server and on Zoom.

# Future Plans

## Itch.IO Implementation 
Due to the collaborative nature of our project, we felt it necessary to make the game accessible beyond our university course. By uploading the game to platforms like Itch.io, we hope to receive feedback from experienced developers and a wider audience. This feedback would help us refine both the narrative and implementation, allowing us to improve the game further.  

## Series Expansion
One of our initial goals was to develop a game series that encompassed all components of health, beyond just mental health. As illustrated in Figure X, we envisioned incorporating aspects such as physical health, represented by models of organs like the lungs. However, due to the time limitations of this project, we were unable to expand beyond the mental health focus. In the future, we hope to create additional installments in the series, using gamification to promote holistic wellbeing across various health components.  

## Expanding to Mobile Platforms
During our presentation, Allan suggested expanding the game to mobile platforms, particularly the Android market. Based on this feedback, we have started exploring ways to adapt the game for tablets and mobile devices, with the goal of uploading it to the Google Play Store. However, some assets do not transfer smoothly to Android at the moment, so adjustments will be needed to ensure compatibility.  

## Introduce Difficulty Levels
Through user testing, we found that the skill level between our testers varied. Whilst some found the game to be easy, others found it difficult. Based on this feedback we plan to introduce different difficulty modes, giving the players the option to choose between easy and hard settings. Our team felt that for the game to be best enjoyed and to invoke the thinking and reflecting element of the game, we would like minimal support text throughout the game, but found that this was not realistic given how long a user would spend playing the game. Through the suggestions of Asma and Allan, we were encouraged to think about different game modes, ensuring that it was accessible to all experiences, skill levels and ages.  

# Acknowledgements

We would like to thank Asma and Allan for their ongoing support throughout the semester. Their insights and critiques have consistently pushed us to think outside the box.  

We are also grateful to our friends and family for their encouragement and support throughout this project.  

A special thanks to Aldo and Mark for their feedback and continuous guidance during the project.  

Lastly, we appreciate the YouTube tutorials and documentation, which were invaluable in helping us create our assets and code.
